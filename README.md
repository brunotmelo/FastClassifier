Fast and flexible toolkit for classifying audios. It uses methods of jAudio and ACE(http://jmir.sourceforge.net/)

To a guide on how to use it, try following the fassclassifier.FastClassifier class.
There is also a guide in Portugues located under documentation. I will add an english one as soon as I can.
